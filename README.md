# How Wallsplash! Works.

An Automated Wallpaper Manager that downloads and your own wallpapers with images taken from the internet, therefore it is necessary to have an active internet connection in order to function. Wallsplash! it is a simple script and very light, however it is able to download images up to 8k UHD, during the quick installation you can choose between some different resolution formats for your desktop, 1080p, 4k, 5k, 8k UHD.

Wallsplash! it is able to work with crontab set to be able to change your background whenever you decide, in fact for example you just need to set the cron job with your terminal editor with the $ cronie -e command, and add the line @hourly ~/.Wallsplash/bin/wbin.sh to get a new wallpaper every hour.

Wallspash! it is written to work in Gnome environment, and it installs and works also on Unity and Cinnamon, it doesnâ€™t work on KDE environment. Wallsplash necessarily needs a notify-send dependency to work so it is suggested to check if the package is already installed by typing, $ notify-send "test" in your terminal, in case you will be returned the missing package error it is mandatory to install it, look for the package for your linux distribution and install it before installing Wallsplash!
